# Harness Health Checklist
> Diagnostic tool for harness_doctor — run at §2 Harness Audit before emitting [audit-finding].
> Fill every Check-NN → tally Score Summary → identify fail domains → [checklist-score] emit.

## Usage
1. Load this file at start of §2 Harness Audit
2. For each Check-NN: grep/review session transcript or tool call log
3. Mark [ ] pass / [~] partial / [x] fail per check
4. Total score → emit `[checklist-score] total: N/85 · fails: <domains>`
5. Each [x] fail → becomes an [audit-finding] entry
