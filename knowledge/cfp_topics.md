# CFP Topics — Canonical Topic Registry
# Source of truth for harness_doctor §1 topic matching
# Every CFP must belong to exactly 1 topic.
# NAMESPACE (T-193): topic ids here are kebab-case and are SEPARATE from the snake_case
#   file-facet topics in knowledge/topic_registry.json. Similar names (token-tracking vs
#   token_tracking) are NOT the same topic — never cross-assign. See topic_facet_schema.md §9.
