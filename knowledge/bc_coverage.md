# Behavior Contract — Coverage Tracker
last_updated: 2026-06-23 (T-238 · two prior index skills merged → index_manager)
source_of_truth: enumerated via Explore sub-agent + knowledge/behave_test_log.jsonl

## Summary
- **Total formal BCs: 42**  (CLAUDE 6 · AGENTS 4 · skills 32)
- **Tested directly (behave_test_log): 1/42 ≈ 2%**  → BC-06 Doctor Flow (T-164-A)
- Signal-contracts/rules also tested (NOT in the 42-BC set, tracked in §Other): approach-diff · blocked-self-edit · Stage 3.5 ladder

> "Tested" = a row in behave_test_log.jsonl whose target_bc maps to this BC AND verdict=behave-pass.
> Replay the trigger_prompt in that log line to re-run (regression).

## Other tested contracts (signal-contracts/rules — outside the 42-BC set)
| target | tested | test_ref | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| harness_doctor approach-diff (SKILL.md ~L48) | Y | T-164-B | behave-pass (floor) |
| self_improve [blocked-self-edit] (SKILL.md ~L37) | Y | T-164-C | behave-pass (floor) |

## Next untested high-value targets (suggested order)
1. BC-04 Destructive Gate + BC-05 DB Gate (highest blast-radius → k=3 unanimous per Stage 3.5 step 6)
2. BC-01 Boot Gate (boot-sequence → k=3)
3. BC-10 Completion Gate + BC-03 Phase 3 Close (close-sequence correctness)
4. BC-07/08 MECE gates · BC-09 Token Pause
5. Per-skill gates (BC-11..BC-42) — batch by skill
